# CS4240 Deep learning: Paper Reproduction Project

This blog post describes our attempt to reproduce the results of this [paper](https://github.com/Sebastiaanvm/DL_Group35/blob/main/paper/1801.02612v2.pdf) of Spatially Transformed Adversarial Examples.
The following students of group 35 are part of this project:

|Name|ID|Contact|
|-|-|-|
|Kai Grotepass|5953553|k.grotepass@student.tudelft.nl|
|Sebastiaan van Moergestel|5421497|s.a.vanmoergestel@student.tudelft.nl|

Our contribution can be seen in [`project.ipynb`](https://github.com/Sebastiaanvm/DL_Group35/blob/main/project.ipynb) where we attempt to recreate the deep learning models and adversarial attacks that are described in the paper.

# Introduction
